## Overview

This project is a simple space shooter game created using the Arduino IDE, designed to run on the WIO Terminal hardware. In this game, your objective is to avoid contact with enemy rocks by skillfully maneuvering your player's spaceship and shooting missiles to eliminate threats.

## Hardware Requirements

- **WIO Terminal:** The game is designed to run on WIO Terminal, a compact and versatile development board.
- **Buttons:** The game utilizes the hardware buttons on the WIO Terminal for player interaction.

## How to Play

1. **Player's Spaceship:** Use the built-in buttons to control the movement of your spaceship.
   - *Left Button:* Rotate spaceship left.
   - *Right Button:* Rotate spaceship right.
   - *Up Button:* Accelerate the spaceship.

2. **Missiles:** Press the 'A' button to fire missiles.
   - *A Button:* Launch missiles to eliminate enemy rocks.

3. **Avoid Enemies:** The goal is to survive by avoiding contact with enemy rocks. Use your agility and missiles to stay clear of the threats.
